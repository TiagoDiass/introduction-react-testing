I have separate this branch for people who want to start following my full video on an introduction to automated testing in React applications. In the end of this lesson, you'll have seen: 
  - what are automated tests
  - how they can help you
  - basic syntax of tests in Javascript/Typescript projects
  - how to test React components (we'll see that by testing 2 simple components)

### [Click here to check the first video](https://youtu.be/hm6RHlOBNcY)

If you want to follow the video series coding with me, start your project from here. Just follow the steps below:

assuming you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your computer:

- Open a terminal where you want to clone the project
- Follow the instructions below:

```
# Clone the repository in this specific branch
$ git clone --branch starter https://github.com/TiagoDiass/introduction-react-testing.git

# Enter the project folder after you cloned it
$ cd introduction-react-testing

# Install the dependencies with Yarn or NPM
$ yarn install
# OR
$ npm install
```

If you want to upload this code to a Github repository later, follow the steps below:

```
# Assuming you are inside the introduction-react-testing folder, still in your terminal

# Delete the .git folder so you can commit all the code yourself and upload it to Github later
# Note: rm is a command for Unix based terminals, use the second option if you're on Windows
$ rm -rf .git
# OR
$ rmdir .git

# Initialize a Git Repository
$ git init

# Create your first commit
$ git add . && git commit -m "chore: initial commit"

# Add your repository as the remote origin of the local repository
$ git remote add origin <your_gitub_repo_url>

# Do your first push to your default branch, which usually is the "main" branch
$ git push -u origin <your_default_branch_name>

# The next times you want to push code, just commit and go with a "git push", no needs to put the "-u origin <your_gitub_repo_url>"
```

Hope you enjoyed this project and that those instructions have helped you :smiley:<br>
