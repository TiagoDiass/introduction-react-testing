I have separate this branch for people who want to start following my full tutorial of building this front-end application with React, Next.js, Typescript, Styled Components and **_more!_**

### [Click here to check the video where I build this app](https://devjobs-tiago.vercel.app/)

If you want to start your project from here, just follow the steps below:

assuming you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your computer:

- Open a terminal where you want to create the project
- Follow the instructions below:

```
# Clone the repository in this specific branch
$ git clone --branch starter https://github.com/TiagoDiass/gitfinder.git

# Enter the project folder after you cloned it
$ cd gitfinder

# Install the dependencies with Yarn or NPM
$ yarn install
# OR
$ npm install
```

If you want to upload this code to a Github repository later, follow the steps below:

```
# Assuming you are inside the gitfinder folder, still in your terminal

# Delete the .git folder so you can commit all the code yourself and upload it to Github later
# Note: rm is a command for Unix based terminals, use the second option if you're on Windows
$ rm -rf .git
# OR
$ rmdir .git

# Initialize a Git Repository
$ git init

# Create your first commit
$ git add . && git commit -m "chore: initial commit"

# Add your repository as the remote origin of the local repository
$ git remote add origin <your_gitub_repo_url>

# Do your first push to your default branch, which usually is the "main" branch
$ git push -u origin <your_default_branch_name>

# The next times you want to push code, just commit and go with a "git push", no needs to put the "-u origin <your_gitub_repo_url>"
```

Hope you enjoyed this project and that those instructions have helped you :smiley:<br>
