I have separate this repo for people who want to start following my full video on an introduction to automated testing in React applications. In the end of this lesson, you'll have seen: 
  - what are automated tests
  - how they can help you
  - basic syntax of tests in Javascript/Typescript projects
  - how to test React components (we'll see that by testing 2 simple components)
